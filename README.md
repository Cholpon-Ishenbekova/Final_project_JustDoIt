# Final_project_JustDoIt
This is my final project  "Just to Do It"

The project consists of three main files 
-JustDoIt
-JustDoItController
-JustDoIt.fxml

Also style.css for styling app

The problem that I wanted to solve with my app: The problem was my procrastination of doing this final project. That why I decided to make such a program that helps me to focus and complete final project. 

The description: JustDoIt project using pomodoro method helps user to focus and to have done tasks that user created. Timer with two buttons like Start and Reset, user can start the timer (25 min) and stop according to user preference. Also, user can reset the timer and start from the begining. 

Tasks with Add button can be added by order and also with Clear All button user can clean all tasks. 

Further improvement of project: 
1. To add Done and Delete buttons to each task 
2. With mysql database create login and sign up sections

Problems that I could not solve: 
1. I really wanted to create login and sign up, but I had problem with connection to mysql. I spent for this 4 days, but still couldn't manage it 
2. I had bug with adding two buttons Done and Delete to each function (I spent 2 days, but still couldn't debug, that why it's without those functions)
